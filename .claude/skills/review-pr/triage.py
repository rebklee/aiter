    """(module, symbol) -> [aot files importing it]: the contract AOT copies from runtime.

    FlyDSL keeps a second copy of "which variant do we compile" under aiter/aot/flydsl/,
    and the copy drifts. Five of the 21 precise FlyDSL fixes are that drift, and the
    deleted comment in e4c980fec is its confession -- "Match the RT condition in
    fused_moe.py / test_moe_2stage.py" -- a hand-copied runtime condition that stopped
    matching.

    Pairing is by SYMBOL. Two cheaper schemes were measured and rejected:

      name similarity  what sibling_variants already does, which is why A1 never caught
                       this: `parse_csv` and `resolve_flydsl_stage1_tile_n` share nothing.
      directory mirror aot/flydsl/X.py <-> ops/flydsl/X_kernels.py does not hold.
                       chunk_gdn_h.py imports kernels.gdr_prefill and kernels.tensor_shim
                       and there is no chunk_gdn_h_kernels.py; gemm.py alone imports 11
                       ops-side modules. The mirror is a coincidence on three files.

    The import statement is the thing that actually holds: 24 modules, 62 symbols on the
    tree this was written against. Symbol level and not module level is what keeps it
    quiet -- editing an ops-side module without touching AOT is routine, editing one of
    these 62 definitions is not.

    candidates per 50 PRs, real work by any measure -- and 28% of what survives it and

    own finding catches a premise you never tested. It does not catch a conclusion you are
    committed to, and no amount of instructing yourself harder substitutes for a reader who
    was never committed.

    The step does not require the ability to spawn anything. Hand $WORK/card.md, the diff
    and the merge-target path to a second agent or a person, with no part of your reasoning
    attached, and record what comes back. What this gate can check is that it happened, per
    finding, with something named that a third party could open -- and, when no such reader

    silently reports nothing. aiter#4994 is the worked example: it added
